  "summary": "Live price: $65,371 (24h: -3.13%).\n24h range: $65,243 – $68,309.\nMomentum: bearish over the last day; watch whether price holds above the 65k area.",
  "prediction": "Next 24–48h: likely consolidation with a bearish bias while below ~$68,309. If BTC holds above support (~$65,243) and reclaims $66k–$67k, a bounce toward ~$68k is plausible. A clean break below ~$65,243 increases downside risk toward the $63k–$64k zone.",
