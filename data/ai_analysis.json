  "summary": "Bitcoin is trading around $67,290, down approximately 2.2% in the last 24 hours. The market sentiment is currently in 'Extreme Fear' (Index: 11), suggesting oversold conditions or high panic. The price has retraced from a daily high of $69,292.",
  "prediction": "Given the extreme fear and the pull back to the 65k-67k zone, a relief bounce might be expected if support at 65.7k holds. However, continued fear could drive prices lower to test the 64k-65k region. The trend is currently bearish/corrective in the short term.",
